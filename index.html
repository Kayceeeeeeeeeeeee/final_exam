		<p>
		My journey with Information Technology began with a simple curiosity.
		I remember as a child, being mesmerized by the way computers could bring stories to life through video games.
		Each pixel, each line of code, felt like a tiny magic trick,
		and I desperately wanted to understand the secrets behind it all.
		It was like learning a new language that could open up whole new worlds,
		and I couldn't resist the urge to explore. So, with wide-eyed wonder and a heart full of excitement,
		I embarked on the path of Information Technology, eager to unlock the mysteries of the digital realm. </p>
		
		<p>
        My life as an IT student has been a journey of quiet determination. 
		While others seemed to effortlessly grasp new concepts, I often felt like I was wading through mud, 
		struggling to keep my head above water. The frustration of being a "slow learner" was a constant companion,
		gnawing at my confidence and self-esteem.
		Thanks to my friends, they help me a lot to these situations. They help me survive everday, and im thankful for everything
        they do for me.	</p>
